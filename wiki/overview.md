# Secure Access Control System - Overview

## Features

- Dashboard access based on roles
- Session handling
- Logout and timeout functionality

Title: Create login functionality with username and password

Description:
Implement a secure login feature where users can enter a username and password to gain access to a protected area of the application. If credentials are valid, users are redirected to a success page. If invalid, an error message is shown.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the login.html page.

Enter a sample username and password.

Click the "Login" button.

Expected Behavior:
Users with correct credentials are redirected to a success.html page, while users with incorrect credentials see an error message on error.html.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, login functionality does not exist. No input validation or credential matching is implemented yet.

Additional Context:

User credentials will be stored in a users.txt file or a simple data structure.

Basic validation and sanitization will be added to prevent injection attacks.

Future enhancements may include hashing passwords.
