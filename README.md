# 🛡️ S25_CSS_G2_BR_SL – Computer Systems Security Project

This project is focused on building a **secure access control system** that simulates real-world enterprise-level security policies and implementations. It is designed for educational use, primarily within the context of a Computer Systems Security course, and demonstrates how secure login systems, multi-factor authentication, HR integration, and automated access control can be built using Python, Flask, and HTML.

## 🔍 Project Objective

The goal is to develop a practical and extensible system that shows how to:

- Authenticate users with a username and password
- Add a second layer of authentication (2FA)
- React to HR offboarding events to revoke user access
- Assign time-based temporary access roles
- Log all security actions for auditing and compliance

By completing this project, students and contributors will gain hands-on experience with core security concepts, such as **role-based access control**, **authentication protocols**, and **security automation**.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Login System**  
  Secure login with username/password validation and error handling.

- **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**  
  An optional second authentication step using a code sent via email, SMS, or generated by an app.

- **HR System Integration**  
  Detects offboarding events (employee termination) and triggers access revocation.

- **Automatic Access Revocation**  
  Automatically disables user access and removes all roles upon offboarding.

- **Temporary Access Roles**  
  Allows admin to grant short-term access to users like contractors, which automatically expires after a set duration.

- **Security Logging**  
  All access changes are logged for auditability.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.11**
- **Flask (Micro Web Framework)**
- **HTML/CSS** (for basic UI)
- **File-based storage** (text files for simplicity)
- Optional: `pyotp`, `smtplib`, `datetime`, `schedule` for advanced features

---

## 📖 Use Cases

- Simulating how an enterprise might automate access control  
- Teaching cybersecurity students the workflow behind secure systems  
- Practicing full-stack security-aware development
