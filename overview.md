# Secure Access Control System - Overview

## Objective
To implement a secure, role-based access system for corporate environments using password and multifactor authentication.

## Features
- User login with 2FA
- Dashboard access based on roles
- Session handling
- Logout and timeout functionality

Title: Create login functionality with username and password

Description:
Implement a secure login feature where users can enter a username and password to gain access to a protected area of the application. If credentials are valid, users are redirected to a success page. If invalid, an error message is shown.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the login.html page.

Enter a sample username and password.

Click the "Login" button.

Expected Behavior:
Users with correct credentials are redirected to a success.html page, while users with incorrect credentials see an error message on error.html.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, login functionality does not exist. No input validation or credential matching is implemented yet.

Additional Context:

User credentials will be stored in a users.txt file or a simple data structure.

Basic validation and sanitization will be added to prevent injection attacks.

Future enhancements may include hashing passwords.

Title: Add second authentication factor after password verification

Description:
After the user successfully enters the correct username and password, prompt them for a second authentication factor (e.g., verification code). This adds an extra layer of security to prevent unauthorized access even if credentials are compromised.

Steps to Reproduce:

Login with correct username and password.

Prompt appears asking for second factor (e.g., a 6-digit verification code).

User enters code and submits.

Expected Behavior:
User is only granted access to the success.html page after passing both password and second-factor verification.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, users are redirected to the success page after only entering a correct username and password. There is no second factor involved.

Additional Context:

The second factor could be a hardcoded code, time-based code (like Google Authenticator), or sent via email/text.

Helps align with multi-factor authentication (MFA) best practices.

You can use Python’s smtplib for email, twilio for SMS, or pyotp for app-based codes.

TASKS:

 Choose how to send the code (email, SMS, or app)

 Make system send code after correct password

 Create page to enter the code

 Check if the code is correct

 Let user in if both steps pass

Title: Integrate HR system to detect employee offboarding events

Description:
Develop functionality that connects to the HR system to monitor and detect when an employee is offboarded (i.e., leaves the organization). This detection should trigger automatic revocation of access to internal systems, enforcing proper access control.

Steps to Reproduce:

HR system flags an employee as offboarded or terminated.

The system polls or receives a trigger about the change.

Access credentials are revoked and sessions terminated.

Expected Behavior:
When offboarding is detected, the user's system access is automatically revoked, and logs are updated for compliance and audit tracking.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, the system has no awareness of HR changes. Access revocation is manual and potentially delayed.


Additional Context:

Use a mock or real HR data source (like a JSON file, database, or API).

Design for future automation or webhook support.

Ensure changes are logged and reversible only by admins.

TASKS:

 Implement integration with HR system to detect when an employee is marked as offboarded or terminated

 Trigger automated access revocation upon detection

 Log each offboarding action for auditing

 Verify access is blocked after revocation

 Create test cases to simulate offboarding scenarios

Title: Implement Automatic Access Revocation Logic Based on Offboarding Events

Description:
Develop the back-end logic that automatically revokes a user’s access to the system once they are flagged as offboarded by the HR system. This ensures that terminated employees cannot access sensitive resources after departure.

Steps to Reproduce:

HR system flags a user as offboarded or terminated.

Access control module processes the offboarding flag.

The system removes login ability, assigned roles, and credentials.

Expected Behavior:
The user’s access is completely revoked — all roles, credentials, and permissions are stripped, and the user can no longer authenticate or perform any system action.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, access remains active after offboarding unless manually revoked.

Additional Context:

This is a continuation of Issue #3 (detecting offboarding events).

The revocation should be immediate and logged for auditing purposes.

Roles and permissions may be stored in a file, database, or session variable — design accordingly.

TASKS:

 Develop logic to automatically revoke system access when an offboarding event is detected

 Remove all assigned roles, permissions, and credentials

 Invalidate all login sessions and prevent future logins

 Log revocation activity with user ID, timestamp, and reason

 Test with simulated offboarding events to ensure full coverage

Title: Add Temporary Access Role Functionality

Description:
Create functionality that allows administrators to assign temporary access roles (e.g., for interns or contractors) that automatically expire after a set time. This prevents long-term access for users who only need short-term permissions.

Steps to Reproduce:

Admin selects a user and assigns a temporary role.

Admin sets an expiration duration (e.g., 2 hours, 7 days).

The system grants the role and starts a countdown.

After the configured time, the role is automatically removed.

Expected Behavior:
Temporary roles are applied immediately and expire automatically when their duration ends, revoking access without admin intervention.

Actual Behavior:
The current system does not differentiate between temporary and permanent roles. All roles remain active until manually removed.

Additional Context:

Temporary roles help enforce least privilege principles.

Useful for onboarding short-term users or giving time-boxed elevated access.

Implementing this may require a time-based revocation mechanism or scheduled background job.

TASKS:

 Implement support for assigning temporary access roles to users such as interns and contractors

 Allow admins to configure the role duration upon assignment

 Track and monitor role expiration times

 Revoke roles automatically once the duration expires

 Log when temporary access is granted and revoked

Title: Create HR Interface for Granting Temporary Access

Description:
Develop a user-friendly interface for HR personnel to grant temporary access roles to users such as interns, contractors, or newly onboarded employees. The interface should allow HR to search for a user, assign a temporary role, set a duration, and validate against organizational policy limits.

Steps to Reproduce:

HR manager logs into the HR dashboard.

Navigates to the "Grant Temporary Access" section.

Searches for a user by name or ID.

Selects access level and sets duration.

Submits the form to grant access.

Expected Behavior:
HR can efficiently assign access with proper controls in place. The system ensures the duration does not exceed preset limits, and logs the event.

Actual Behavior:
There is currently no interface or automated way for HR to assign temporary access roles.

Additional Context:

Integrates with Issue #5 (temporary access logic)

Should include real-time validation (e.g., max 30 days)

Designed for ease of use by non-technical HR staff

Could use Flask form with dropdowns and date/time fields

TASKS:

 Develop a user-friendly interface in the HR dashboard that allows HR managers to grant temporary access to users

 HR can search for and select a user

 HR can specify access level and duration

 System validates that the duration does not exceed policy limits

 Connect interface to backend access control logic

 Provide confirmation feedback and logging

Title: Implement Email Token Generation and Validation

Description:
Develop backend functionality that generates a secure, time-limited token when a user requests a password reset. The system should send this token to the user’s email within a reset link. When the user clicks the link and enters a new password, the system must validate the token before allowing the password update.

Steps to Reproduce:

User clicks “Forgot Password” on the login page.

System generates a unique token and sends it to the user’s email with a reset link.

User clicks the link and is taken to a password reset form.

User enters a new password and submits.

System validates the token and updates the password.

Expected Behavior:
Token is securely generated and emailed. It expires after a set time, is valid only once, and allows the user to securely reset their password.

Actual Behavior:
There is no current functionality for password reset or token generation.

Additional Context:

Use libraries such as secrets, itsdangerous, or uuid for token generation.

Email body should include a secure URL like https://example.com/reset?token=abc123...

Token should be hashed/stored securely and expire in ~10–15 minutes.

Reset form should enforce strong password policies and validation.

TASKS:

 Develop backend logic to generate a secure, time-limited token when a user requests a password reset

 Ensure token is single-use and securely stored/validated

 Send token via email inside a password reset link

 Create a secure password reset form for the user to submit a new password

 Invalidate token after it’s used or expired

 Log reset attempts and completions for security auditing

Title: Implement a Form Accessible Through the Tokenized Link, Allowing Users to Enter and Confirm a New Password

Description:
Create a secure password reset form that is only accessible via a valid tokenized link sent to the user’s email. The form should allow users to enter and confirm a new password, validate both inputs, and update the password only if the token is valid and not expired.

Steps to Reproduce:

User clicks on a password reset link received by email.

System verifies the token and displays the password reset form.

User enters and confirms a new password.

System validates and updates the password if token and inputs are valid.

Expected Behavior:
The form enforces strong password rules, ensures both fields match, and only allows resets using a valid, active token.

Actual Behavior:
There is currently no form for password reset through tokenized links.

Additional Context:

Token validation must occur before password reset is allowed.

Password must meet minimum complexity: e.g., length, uppercase, symbol, number.

Limit token usage and form access to prevent brute force or abuse.

Rate-limit or CAPTCHA may be used to protect endpoint.

TASKS:

 Requires both new password and confirmation fields

 Form validates token before allowing password reset

 Strong password requirements are enforced

 Add security measures to prevent abuse of password reset feature

 Redirect users with success or failure messages

 Log reset attempts for audit and security review

Title: Implement Rate Limiting and CAPTCHA to Prevent Brute-Force or Spam Attempts on the Password Reset Feature

Description:
Enhance the password reset feature's security by adding rate limiting and CAPTCHA protection. These measures prevent brute-force attacks, repeated spam submissions, and abuse of the reset functionality by limiting the number of reset attempts and verifying user authenticity.

Steps to Reproduce:

Navigate to the password reset form.

Submit multiple reset requests rapidly using the same or different emails.

Attempt to trigger a CAPTCHA or bypass the form’s limits.

Expected Behavior:
The system should restrict excessive reset requests per IP/email, prompt for CAPTCHA when thresholds are exceeded, and log any suspicious activity.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, the system does not limit reset attempts or use CAPTCHA, leaving it vulnerable to automated abuse.

Additional Context:

CAPTCHA can be integrated using Google reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, or a simple math challenge.

Flask extensions like Flask-Limiter can enforce request thresholds.

Logs can be stored in a local file or security event log for review.

TASKS:

 CAPTCHA added to request form after repeated attempts

 Limit reset requests per IP/email within a time frame

 Log suspicious activities

 Display clear error or warning messages for blocked actions

 Allow legitimate users to retry after cooldown period

 Ensure CAPTCHA is accessible and responsive for all users

Title: Alert System for Suspicious Login Attempts and Unauthorized Access

Description:
Implement an alerting system that detects suspicious login behavior and unauthorized access attempts. When triggered, the system should notify designated administrators via email or another communication method (e.g., Slack). This is essential for timely threat detection and response.

Steps to Reproduce:

Trigger multiple failed login attempts.

Attempt to access restricted areas without authentication.

Log in from a suspicious or unrecognized IP or device.

Expected Behavior:
The system should detect and flag unusual behavior, then alert an admin or log the event in real-time.

Actual Behavior:
No monitoring or alerting currently exists. Login activity is not actively tracked or responded to.

Additional Context:

Detection thresholds (e.g., 3 failed logins within 1 minute) can be configurable.

Alerts can be sent via SMTP email, Slack webhook, or a dashboard view.

Should work in tandem with the audit logging and rate limiting already planned.

TASKS:

 Design detection logic for triggering alerts

 Implement monitoring for login activities

 Integrate alert notification system (e.g., email, Slack)

 Document the alert system in the security section of the knowledge base

 Create test scenarios to validate alert triggers

 Ensure alert throttling to avoid spam/flooding

Title: Alert Management Dashboard for Suspicious Login Attempts

Description:
Create a secure administrative dashboard to manage and review alerts triggered by suspicious login attempts and unauthorized access activities. The dashboard should allow authorized personnel to view, filter, and act on alerts in real time, helping the organization respond quickly to potential security threats.

Steps to Reproduce:

System generates an alert after suspicious behavior (e.g., 5 failed login attempts).

Admin accesses the alert management dashboard.

Views list of active alerts and takes action (e.g., mark as reviewed or escalate).

Expected Behavior:
Admins can log in to a protected dashboard, view recent alerts, filter them, and take defined actions like acknowledging or escalating. The system restricts access to authorized users only.

Actual Behavior:
There is currently no interface or tool for managing or tracking security alerts.

Additional Context:

UI may use an HTML table layout with Bootstrap or another lightweight framework.

Filtering could be by user, severity, date, or alert type.

Actions taken on alerts should be logged for auditing purposes.

Access to the dashboard must be limited to predefined admin roles.

TASKS:

 Design UI layout for the alert management dashboard

 Implement alert list view with relevant data fields (user, IP, time, alert type)

 Add filtering and search capabilities

 Enable actions: mark as reviewed, acknowledge, escalate

 Ensure access controls restrict dashboard to authorized roles

 Document dashboard usage and permissions

Title: Logging and Audit Trail for User Access and Permission Changes

Description:
Implement a secure, tamper-resistant audit logging system to track user access events and permission changes. This system is critical for compliance, accountability, and forensic analysis in the event of a breach or policy violation. Logs must be queryable by authorized personnel and protected from unauthorized tampering or exposure.

Steps to Reproduce:

A user logs in or accesses a protected system feature.

An admin assigns, revokes, or modifies a user’s roles or permissions.

The system records these events into the audit log.

An auditor accesses the logs through a UI or export function.

Expected Behavior:
All sensitive access and permission changes are logged with metadata (user, timestamp, action). Logs are only viewable by authorized roles and can be exported or filtered for review.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, no audit logging is implemented. Actions are not being tracked or reviewed.

Additional Context:

Log format may be JSON, plaintext, or database-based

Consider hash chaining or digital signatures to ensure tamper detection

Events may include: login success/failure, 2FA activity, access grant/revoke, password reset, temporary role assignment

TASKS:

 Define schema for audit logs (access events and permission changes)

 Implement logging of user access events

 Implement logging of permission and role changes

 Ensure logs are stored securely and are tamper-resistant

 Build a UI or export mechanism for auditors to review logs

 Restrict access to audit logs via role-based permissions

 Write unit and integration tests for log generation and access control

Title: Implement Log Retention Policy and Alerts for Sensitive Permission Changes

Description:
Strengthen the audit logging framework by introducing a log retention policy that automatically archives or purges logs after a defined period, and by generating real-time alerts for high-risk permission changes. This ensures sensitive actions like admin role assignments are monitored closely and audit logs remain compliant with organizational data policies.

Steps to Reproduce:

Grant or revoke a high-privilege role (e.g., admin, auditor).

The system triggers a real-time alert and stores the event.

Wait for logs to exceed the retention period and verify archival/purging.

Expected Behavior:
Sensitive changes trigger immediate alerts. Logs are automatically managed according to the retention policy and remain immutable, accessible only to authorized users.

Actual Behavior:
No alerting or automated retention process exists. Logs may grow uncontrolled and sensitive changes can go unnoticed.

Additional Context:

Retention may be enforced via cron jobs, Flask background tasks, or serverless jobs

Immutability may be achieved using hashing, append-only files, or WORM storage

Alerts can be tied into Slack, email, or an internal dashboard

TASKS:

 Implement automated log archival or purging process

 Identify high-risk permission changes that require alerting

 Implement alert generation for flagged permission changes

 Ensure audit log storage supports immutability and integrity validation

 Add automated tests for log retention and alert triggering

 Create internal documentation on log policy and alert scope

Title: Access Request Approval Workflow for Department Managers

Description:
Develop a secure access request and approval workflow where team members can request elevated roles or system permissions, which must be reviewed and approved by their designated department manager. This ensures that access is granted only with proper oversight and aligns with least-privilege policies.

Steps to Reproduce:

A team member fills out a request form specifying the desired role and justification.

The system routes the request to the assigned department manager.

The manager reviews and approves or denies the request.

The user is granted access upon approval or notified of denial.

Expected Behavior:
Only users whose requests are approved by their assigned manager are granted access. All actions (submission, review, decision) are logged with timestamps and user IDs.

Actual Behavior:
There is currently no approval workflow or formal access request structure in place.

Additional Context:

Useful for onboarding, new project assignments, or temporary access

May use a Flask route like /access-request and /manager-dashboard

Logs should be written to the existing audit log system

Manager-user mappings can be stored in a config file, DB, or HR integration

TASKS:

 Create access request form for team members

 Implement backend logic to route requests to appropriate department manager

 Design and build manager dashboard for pending requests

 Enable approve/deny functionality with optional comments

 Send notifications to managers for new requests

 Log all actions (requests, approvals, denials) with timestamps and user IDs

 Apply access control to ensure managers only see relevant requests

Title: Notifications and Escalation Workflow for Access Requests

Description:
Develop a robust notification and escalation system to ensure access requests are acted on in a timely manner. The system should notify department managers of new requests, send reminders for pending approvals, and escalate overdue requests to fallback approvers or higher-level admins. Users should also be kept informed of their request status throughout the process.

Steps to Reproduce:

A team member submits an access request.

The department manager is notified.

If the request is not reviewed after a defined interval, a reminder is sent.

If still unresolved, the request escalates to a fallback approver.

The user is notified of any changes to the request status.

Expected Behavior:
Managers receive timely alerts, and no request is left unattended. Escalations occur automatically, users are kept informed, and all actions are logged.

Actual Behavior:
No current system for automated reminders, escalations, or user status notifications exists.

Additional Context:

Escalation timeframes should be configurable (e.g., 24h, 48h)

Notifications can be via email, Slack, or in-app dashboard alerts

Manager preferences could include opting in/out of certain notification types

TASKS:

 Implement notification system for new and pending access requests

 Add reminder notifications for unreviewed requests after defined intervals

 Design escalation logic for overdue requests

 Identify and configure fallback approvers for escalation

 Notify users of request status changes

 Add settings for managers to customize notification preferences

Title: Align Access Control Policies with Industry Compliance Standards

Description:
Ensure the project’s access control mechanisms comply with major industry regulations and standards (e.g., NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, HIPAA, SOC 2). This involves conducting a gap analysis, updating policies, collaborating with security teams, and preparing the system for internal/external audits. The end goal is to formalize, document, and enforce access governance that meets industry compliance expectations.

Steps to Reproduce:

Select a standard (e.g., NIST 800-53 or ISO 27001).

Review current access control workflows and policies.

Identify any gaps or non-compliant practices.

Implement necessary changes and document alignment.

Expected Behavior:
Access controls are aligned with industry standards, documented formally, and supported by an audit trail. Training and enforcement reflect these policies across the project.

Actual Behavior:
Controls are implemented functionally but have not yet been audited or mapped to official compliance frameworks.

Additional Context:

This issue supports audit-readiness and risk reduction

Formal policy alignment benefits future enterprise integration, funding, or deployment

Examples of compliance targets:

NIST 800-53 Rev 5 (AC family)

ISO/IEC 27001 Annex A.9

HIPAA Security Rule

SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria

Title: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) According to Updated Compliance Policies

Description:
Develop and enforce a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) system that reflects the newly updated, compliance-aligned access control policies. This model ensures that users are only granted access based on their role, with permissions assigned according to regulatory best practices like least privilege, separation of duties, and auditability.

Steps to Reproduce:

Review updated access control policies aligned with NIST, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or SOC 2.

Define key system roles (e.g., User, HR, Manager, Admin, Auditor).

Map each role to its allowed actions and access boundaries.

Apply role enforcement in the system and test.

Expected Behavior:
Each user can only access and perform actions permitted by their role. Unauthorized access is prevented and logged, and documentation supports audit readiness.

Actual Behavior:
Access enforcement may be inconsistent or not fully aligned with policy updates.

Additional Context:

Roles should be structured to reflect operational needs and compliance requirements

Supports audit trail for role assignment and privilege elevation

May use Flask decorators or middleware for route-level role enforcement

TASKS:

 Review updated compliance-aligned access control policies

Title: Audit Existing User Accounts for Role Compliance

Description:
Perform a comprehensive audit of all active user accounts to ensure that their assigned roles and permissions align with the approved Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model. This will help detect role misassignments, prevent privilege creep, and ensure adherence to compliance requirements.

Steps to Reproduce:

Generate a report of all active users and their current roles/permissions.

Match each role against the documented RBAC definitions.

Flag any accounts with excessive or misaligned privileges.

Correct and document any role adjustments.

Expected Behavior:
All users hold roles appropriate to their function. Any anomalies are corrected and logged as part of the audit trail.

Actual Behavior:
There may be outdated or manually assigned roles that do not comply with the current RBAC structure.

Additional Context:

This audit supports SOC 2, NIST, and ISO compliance audits

Audit findings should be logged and reported to compliance and security stakeholders

Can be automated using a script or manually verified if the user base is small

TASKS:

 Export list of all active users and their current permissions

 Compare roles to RBAC definitions

 Reassign incorrect roles as needed

 Flag anomalies or excessive privileges for review

Title: Set Up Automated Alerts for Unauthorized Access Attempts

Description:
Build an automated alerting system that monitors for and responds to unauthorized access attempts such as failed logins, invalid token usage, or restricted resource access. This system should notify security personnel or admins in real-time when thresholds are crossed, enhancing detection and response capabilities.

Steps to Reproduce:

A user attempts to log in multiple times with incorrect credentials.

A user tries to access an endpoint without sufficient privileges.

Alert is triggered based on pre-defined conditions and sent to admin.

Expected Behavior:
Unauthorized attempts are detected and alerts are delivered instantly via email or shown in the system dashboard.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, unauthorized access attempts may be logged, but no real-time alert system is in place.

Additional Context:

Thresholds could include:

3+ failed login attempts in 5 minutes

Access to restricted URL without proper role

Reuse of expired or invalid token

Alerts should not overwhelm admins—apply throttling or escalation when needed

TASKS:

 Define thresholds for alert triggers

 Set up alerting via email or dashboard notifications

 Test alert functionality with simulated failed logins

Title: Conduct Access Control Penetration Testing

Description:
Perform penetration testing targeting the system's access control components. The goal is to uncover vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation, unauthorized access to restricted data or functions, and broken role enforcement. Findings will be used to strengthen the RBAC system and ensure compliance with security best practices.

Steps to Reproduce:

Log in as a user with minimal access (e.g., intern, basic user).

Attempt to perform actions or reach views restricted to higher roles (e.g., admin dashboard, role assignment features).

Try manipulating session data, tokens, or request parameters.

Document and patch any successful bypasses.

Expected Behavior:
All unauthorized actions should be blocked by the RBAC enforcement. Any exploit should be fully logged and remediated.

Actual Behavior:
No penetration testing has been performed on the current access control implementation, so vulnerabilities may exist.

Additional Context:

Testing can use tools such as Postman, Burp Suite, curl, or custom Python scripts

Tests should include both vertical and horizontal privilege escalation attempts

Findings may support the internal audit and future compliance reviews

TASKS:

 Prepare test accounts for various roles

 Attempt privilege escalation and unauthorized access

 Document vulnerabilities or bypasses found

Title: Create User Access Review Workflow for Quarterly Audits

Description:
Establish a structured quarterly user access review process that enables IT or security staff to evaluate whether each user’s current role and permissions are still appropriate. This workflow supports regulatory compliance, enforces least-privilege principles, and creates a repeatable audit trail.

Steps to Reproduce:

Identify all active user accounts and their assigned roles.

Assign reviewers to departments or user groups.

Conduct a quarterly session where each account is reviewed.

Document results and take corrective actions (e.g., revoke outdated access).

Expected Behavior:
A repeatable, documented process exists for reviewing user access each quarter, with actions logged and records maintained for compliance.

Actual Behavior:
Currently, user access is not formally reviewed on a recurring basis.

Additional Context:

Required by many compliance frameworks: NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, SOC 2, HIPAA

Results should be stored securely and available for audit review

Process may be triggered automatically via a task scheduler or calendar alert
